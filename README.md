# Road Management System
This is a road management system to keep a track of roads in the region. You can:

1. Check what roads need maintenance
2. what roads have been assigned to various contractors
3. See what roads connect which areas

The tech stack is fairly simple, Microsoft Forms within visual studio using C# and MySql to create a simple database.
